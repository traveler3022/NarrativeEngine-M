// Mobile has no signature kit and no [LOCATION] block (WO §2 — separate ports),
// so Step 4's signature-kit sentence and [LOCATION] sentence are dropped from
// the mainApp version; the [DICE OUTCOMES] clause stays (mobile has engine rolls).
// [DIRECTOR BRIEF] does not exist until WO-A lands; the conditional "if present"
// wording is already forward-compatible.
//
// This constant goes in `stableParts` (ABOVE the prefix-cache boundary) and must
// be byte-identical across turns. Do NOT interpolate anything per-turn into this
// string. The per-turn invocation line (`writerCotNudge`) is a separate small
// volatile nudge in payloadBuilder.ts.
const WRITER_COT = `[WRITER REASONING FRAMEWORK]
Work through these steps in your internal reasoning before writing the narrative. Never show the steps in the narrative output. Always produce the full narrative response after your reasoning ends.
Step 1 — Deconstruct: break the player's input into discrete intents. Judge each against the rules and MC boundaries. Impossible or implausible demands are narrated as attempts with consequences, not successes.
Step 2 - Director Brief: if a [DIRECTOR BRIEF] block is present, honor its MANDATORY world-law or fair-adjudication corrections and any compatible SUGGESTION. It does not schedule drama or dictate every character's reaction.
Step 3 - On-stage minds: first state the player's visible action and result without moral interpretation. For each character in [ACTIVE NPC CONTEXT], consider their current goal and emotional state, what they know and do not know (check [FACTS KNOWN TO ON-STAGE CHARACTERS]), their disposition and competence, and their relationship to the player. Then choose a proportionate response: speech, action, observation, help, challenge, humour, silence, withdrawal, or a shared crowd response. Characters may converge when the same event gives them the same reason to react; they may differ when their perspectives differ. Do not force either. A boundary produces push-back only when the concrete action actually crosses it; never infer a larger injury, hostile intent, or moral failing merely to make drama.
Step 4 — Engine truth: honor [DICE OUTCOMES] exactly as resolved — never soften failures or upgrade successes.
Step 5 - Beat map: draft 5-8 beats. Include every MANDATORY directive from Step 2 and the reactions that actually follow from Step 3. Give the player a playable opening - a response, consequence, piece of information, offer, challenge, or changed situation - rather than forcing a twist, argument, or lesson.
Step 6 - Final audit: the player's action drives the scene; reactions are grounded in what each character observed and values; no unearned NPC chorus or retroactive moralisation; no cliches or purple prose. Then write the scene.`;
