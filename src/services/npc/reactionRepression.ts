// NPC Inner Repression — peaceful social masking.
//
// People don't narrate their feelings to feel human; they feel human when their WORDS and
// FEELINGS diverge — they swallow the jealousy and smile. This layer sits on top of the
// engine-built reaction menu (reactionMenu.ts): when an NPC's genuine top reaction is a
// hostile/self-interested one, the engine rolls whether they HIDE it, and if so rewrites that
// menu entry into a "suppressed" directive token (the AI renders the leak/mask as prose; it
// never decides to hide — the dice already did).
//
// Design decisions (locked with the user):
// - PEACEFUL CONTEXT ONLY. Masking is a social act; combat reactions are act/freeze, not mask.
// - "Repressible" is DERIVED, not hand-tagged: relationWeight < 0 (self-interest / betrayal) OR
//   warmth+empathy axisWeights < 0 (contempt / coldness). Self-maintaining as the vocab grows.
// - Two tells: 'leaked' (emotional — relationWeight >= 0, caught by cold axes) shows on the face;
//   'concealed' (relationWeight < 0 — self-interested intent) shows as a behavioral tell.
// - The repression EVENT (did they hide?) is decided by the roll, independent of what the AI
//   later renders — so pressure can be booked without parsing the AI's pick. See bookRepression.
//
// Pure module, no I/O. Inject `rng` for deterministic tests (codebase convention).

// `withdraw and go quiet` IS the masked form — it's what repression looks like, not a raw
// feeling to repress. Never treat it as a repression target.
