// Relationship Meter — engine-owned affinity accumulator.
//
// The frozen-dial bug: the pcRelation band (−3..+3) only moved when the story AI volunteered a
// delta, and the AI (told to report only "fundamental/transformative" changes) almost never did.
// On top of that a +1 is a whole-band leap (Neutral → Trusted Ally) — far too coarse to move on
// ordinary scenes. So relationships sat frozen for dozens of scenes.
//
// Fix (mirrors the reaction-menu philosophy — AI judges, engine decides): the AI's ONLY job is to
// label each scene's tone toward each on-stage NPC. The engine rolls that label into a hidden
// sub-band meter; the band only flips when the meter crosses a threshold. This makes relationships
// progress invisibly (a classmate you've been kind to is "still neutral, but warming") and only
// cross a band on accumulated weight.
//
// Two asymmetries, both encoding "trust is slow and ceilinged; distrust is fast and bottomless":
//   - THRESHOLD: +100 to rise a band, only −50 to fall.
//   - BIG EVENTS: a 'bonding' (comrade) moment leaps you up but CANNOT push the band above
//     Friendly (+1) — deep devotion is earned only by the slow grind. A 'betrayal' drops you hard
//     with no floor cap (down to Nemesis).
//
// Pure module, no I/O. Inject `rng` for deterministic tests (codebase convention).
